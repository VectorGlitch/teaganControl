# Teagan Control
Never enough teagan~
## What it do?
This plugin will make everyone teagan~ (Messages only and not including username pings.)
Eventually I'd like to allow the plugin to target anyone so you can make everyone whoever you want. Including adding the ability for their avatar to be applied to everyone.

### How to Install
To use this plugin you will need to follow the inscructions in the Vencord Developer Docs. Specifically the following pages:
- [Installing Vencord from Source](https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/)
- [Installing Custom Plugins](https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/custom-plugins/)

It's not super hard... But it's not a simple one-click-done experience.

### Acknowledgement
This plugin is based on a butchering of [ShowMeYourName](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord/tree/main/src/plugins/showMeYourName) a plugin for Vencord by rinicide and [thekodetoad](https://github.com/TheKodeToad).
